## Back Story

My journey started in 2019 when my college professor [Dr. Dhiman Saha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhimansaha/) taught us about [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org/) for our Software Tools and Technology course. Back then I used to have a low-end specs laptop which used to freeze whenever I ran heavy programs. When I installed i3,
I instantly felt the speed because of fewer applications running on startup compared to Ubuntu GNOME and the minimalistic requirements of the window manager itself. I fell in love with this speed and control over my system so I started looking into extensions like i3lock, i3-gaps, neovim, etc.

Here's how i3 looks without any customization:

Fast forward to today (4 years later), I have a high end laptop but I'm still in love with the things I've done so far and deeply grateful for this experience because it gave me so much knowledge about linux and programming in general.

Here's a glimpse of what my current setup looks like:
