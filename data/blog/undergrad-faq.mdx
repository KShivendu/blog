### Who am I to give you advice?

[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshivendu) graduated in 2022, did 5 internships during college, and have been writing software post-grad for 3 years. I currently work remotely for a Germany based OSS database startup called [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) and it's a stateful distributed system (database) which is considered one of the hardest forms of software engineering. It is a globally leading AI/DB startup and is being used by Twitter, Meesho, Quora, Canva, Discord, and many others. I work remotely with an exceptionally talented team of ~12 people from all over the world and I'm paid global standard salary (beyond standard Indian range). I have never worked at a FAANG company myself but my close friends work at Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Intuit, etc. So I have enough context of both sides.

### How to get a good job? Should I prepare DSA or dev?

General rule is focus more on DSA for MNCs and more on dev for startups. Do both if possible because you never know what will work out for your career. I know people focused on academics and DSA but got placed in MNC (Microsoft) via a hackathon. And many large startups (i.e. scale-ups) ask easy-medium level DSAs. Also, DSA (LeetCode) != CP (Codeforces, Codechef). Some other tips:

- Focus on networking: Build connections with seniors/alumni and other successful engineers (attend meetups)
- Contribute open source: Ideally in projects that have commercial value - i.e. either the project is used by many companies (Apache, Cloud Native projects under CNCF, Python/Django, etc) OR it's a product of an OSS company (Qdrant, Signal, Astral)
- Improve DSA: Work a little bit on DSA skills too - atleast till leetcode medium level. You never know what might come in handy.

### What's my regret in college?

Not participating in sports maybe. But it's not a major one. Also, lost 2/4 years of college life because of COVID. IIRC, I did everything else that I wanted to do.

### What did I do in college that's still helping me

Tons of things:

- Networking with people (esp. seniors), speaking publicly (huge win, I was very shy), taking initiatives for society.
- Doing 5 internships and some freelance work that gave me confidence
- Courses like OS, DBMS, Cryptography, Information Retrieval help directly or indirectly.
- Leading/Mentoring in clubs like OpenLake and DSC. I've used my work at OpenLake to prove my passion for open source in multiple interviews.

### How to have a great long term career?

- There have been moments in my life where I didn't feel super optimistic about my programming skills. I used to avoiding unwrapping abstractions (i.e. not going deep) and wanted to just get the task done and be done with it. But I got ahead of that over time (maybe I got inspired by my mentors and youtubers like Hussein Nasser and Arpit Bhayani) and now I build a database which is one of the hardest forms of engineering.
- At one point, you'll get bored of building simple APIs and ask what's next. But my friend that's not end of engineering. If you wanna do the hardest forms of engineering, go into deep tech. This includes distributed systems engineering (ideally stateful systems like databases), language tooling, infra, or ML.
- Work at startup that have high talent density. If your co-workers are exceptional, you'll be forced to become exceptional or be depressed about being a loser. Many companies can pay you well but they can't give you high quality challenging work.

### Will AI take over my job? How to prepare?

Eventually yes, but we have years/decades before that happens. In the meantime, try to be in roles that are hard to master and are growing in demand. Vibe coding works great for side projects but for any production grade software it can't make big changes without messing up badly (yet).

### How to make the best out of my college life in terms of career:

- Find your niche: Use your college years to find what topics you like in Computer Science. This domain exploration should be practical - i.e. interships >>> side projects >> taking a course
- Understand yourself better: For example, you could do ML research internships at top institutes across the world to find if that's your thing. Or work at a hot Indian fintech startup. I didn't like the research part in my first ML internship at IIT Mandi but I liked ML. I did like backend engineering and learning about databases at my internship at FamPay but didn't like the low margins of consumer tech in India. F\*ck around and find out your taste.
- Students are often worried that jobs require experience and experience requires job. You need to realize that you can build side projects, do internships at smaller companies first (sometimes for free if you really can't find anything), and then expand from there.
- You might end up liking different things about different domains. But you'd be able to make out

### Some young people to take inspiration from:

- [Swastik Baranwal](https://x.com/Delta2315)
- [Chinmay Kak](https://x.com/paraschopra/status/1936712272010965289)

### General advice:

- Real world hands on practice is a billion times better than theoretical knowledge and small personal projects.
- If you get two choices, pick the one that's painful in the short term but has high value in the long run. This sounds simple but takes years/decades to truly grasp.
- Your current position doesn't matter. Quarterly/Annual Growth rate does. Move fast, break things.

### Why am I doing this?

My early career decisions were guided by my mentors - especially [Vinod Bollini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinodb) (IITB 2005 Grad). He taught me many things and helped me at right points in my career to make decisions. I often asked him if can help him somehow, but he always asked me to just pay it forward by helping someone else. He taught me to be grateful and it stayed with me. If anything I did helps you, I request you to just help someone else and extend the chain.

### How's the reputation of IIT Bhilai in the real world?

I do a lot of networking in Bangalore with top founders, engineers, and VCs and contrary to what you might believe, IIT Bhilai has a very strong brand value. Although, most of it comes just from the "IIT" part. People don't necessarily know IIT Bhilai but they are definitely impressed the moment they listen "IIT" - they don't care which one. And tbh, it's more like my profile is top notch so the IIT brand acts like cherry on top. So don't doubt your degree contrary to what recent reddit posts with limited world view suggest.

Any great career is made of multiple (relatively independent) great achievements. Cracking JEE was only an early part of it, you all did well. Now it's the next phase of your life. You can easily match or surpass older IIT students if you're working hard. Many of our Alumni are working at top companies, research institutes, or are on their path to start great companies. Just focus on growing your skills and network, everything else is noise. Have bigger achievements in life than just your IIT degree. Only those who haven't done anything significant after JEE will brag about it ;)
