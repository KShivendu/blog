### Who am I to give you advice?

I graduated in 2022, did 5 internships during college, and have been writing software post-grad for 3 years. I currently work remotely for a globally leading Germany based OSS database startup called Qdrant and it's a stateful distributed system (database) which is considered one of the hardest forms of software engineering. I work remotely with a world class team of ~12 people who are truly exceptional. I have never worked at a FAANG company myself but my close friends work at Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Intuit, etc. So I have enough context of both sides.

### How to get a good job? Should I prepare DSA or dev?

Do both if possible because you never know what will work out for your career. I know people focused on academics and DSA but got placed in MNC because via a hackathon. And many large startups (i.e. scale-ups) ask easy-medium level DSAs. Also, DSA (LeetCode) != CP (Codeforces, Codechef). However, if you wanna ask where to focus, general rule is focus more on DSA for MNCs and more on dev for startups. Some other tips:

- Focus on networking: Build connections with seniors/alumni and other successful engineers (attend meetups)
- Contribute open source: Ideally in projects that have commercial value - i.e. either the project is used by many companies (Apache, Cloud Native projects under CNCF, Python/Django, etc) OR it's a product of an OSS company (Qdrant, Signal, Astral)
- Improve DSA: Work a little bit on DSA skills too - atleast till leetcode medium level. You never know what might come in handy.

### What's my regret in college?

Not participating in sports maybe. But it's not a major one. Also, maybe lost 2/4 years of college life because of COVID. IIRC, I did everything else that I wanted to do.

### What did I do in college that's still helping me

Tons of things:

- Networking with people (esp. seniors), speaking publicly (huge win, I was very shy), taking initiatives for society.
- Doing 5 internships and some freelance work that gave me confidence
- Courses like OS, DBMS, Cryptography, Information Retrieval help directly or indirectly.
- Leading clubs like OpenLake. I've used it in Qdrant interview to prove my passion for open source.

### How to have a great long term career?

- There have been moments in my life where I didn't feel super optimistic about my programming skills. I used to avoiding unwrapping abstractions (i.e. not going deep) and wanted to just get the task done and be done with it. But I got ahead of that over time (maybe I got inspired by my mentors and youtubers like Hussein Nasser and Arpit Bhayani) and now I build a database which is one of the hardest forms of engineering.
- At one point, you'll get bored of building simple APIs and ask what's next. But my friend that's not end of engineering. If you wanna do the hardest forms of engineering, go into deep tech. This includes distributed systems engineering (ideally stateful systems like databases), language tooling, infra, or ML.
- Work at startup that have high talent density. If your co-workers are exceptional, you'll be forced to become exceptional or be depressed about being a loser. Many companies can pay you well but they can't give you high quality challenging work.

### Will AI take over my job? How to prepare?

Eventually yes, but we have years/decades before that happens. In the meantime, try to be in roles that are hard to master and are growing in demand. Vibe coding works great for side projects but for any production grade software it can't make big changes without messing up badly (yet).

### General advice:

- Real world hands on practice is a billion times better than theoretical knowledge and small personal projects.
- If you get two choices, pick the one that's painful in the short term but has high value in the long run. This sounds simple but takes years/decades to truly grasp.
- Your current position doesn't matter. Quarterly/Annual Growth rate does. Move fast, break things.
