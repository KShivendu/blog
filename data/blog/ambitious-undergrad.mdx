The markets are very bad for freshers these days. I see every batch making the same mistakes every year. So I decided
to write a blog based on what I think students should do to have a good career in programming. Please note that market and situations change over time so this is my advice on a best effort basis. Things might not be applicable for your goals or

### Me in 1st year

When I entered college, I couldn't:

- Speak on stage.
-
-

### Who is this for?

People who are ambitious. They may or may not be confident in their skills at the moment whether they will be able to pull it off. But you wanna give your best and are willing to take well thoughts bets.

Students used to ask me what should they do DSA or should they focus on doing dev. But now the markets are so bad that neither are working with a high rate of success. So what to do?

- Focus on networking: Build connections with seniors/alumni and

### Long term career

- There have been moments in my life where I didn't feel super optimistic about my programming skills. I started avoiding unwrapping abstractions (i.e. not going deep) and wanted to just get the task done and be done with it. But I got ahead of that and now I build a database which is one of the hardest forms of engineering.
- At one point, you'll get bored of building simple APIs and ask what's next. But my friend that's not end of engineering. If you wanna do the hardest forms of engineering, go into deep tech. This includes distributed systems engineering (ideally stateful systems like databases), language tooling, infra, or ML.
- Work at startup that have high talent density. If your co-workers are exceptional, you'll be forced to become exceptional or be depressed about being a loser. Many companies in this world can pay you well but they can't give you high quality challenging work.

### What drives me

- I have role models that I look upto. My boss/CTO is one of them.
- I'm very philosophical towards things I do. I do things because I'm deeply interested in understanding intelligence, origin of life, and laws of the universe. Programming is my outlet for my deep desire to understand these things.
- I strongly believe in the idea that at least the potent humans shouldn't leave earth without doing something impactful. Steve jobs might have died but he shifted industry in ways that . I agree that it could have been anyone. But at least in our universe he was the guy.
  - This is even more important because most people don't ever get the chances that I'm getting.
  - I cannot let my desire let go wasted by working in some low impact company. It should be useful for humanity.

### Key takeaways:

- Real world practice is a billion times better than theoretical knowledge and small personal projects.
- If you get two choices, pick the one that's painful in the short term but has high value in the long run. This sounds simple but takes years/decades to truly grasp.
- Your current position doesn't matter. Quarterly/Annual Growth rate does. You just
