This is going to be long post but I'm gonna put almost all my learnings here. I'll try to keep it updated as I learn more. So please dare to read it till the end. I hope it helps you in some way.

## Why consider this path?

- You want to grow fast and see the larger picture of the tech and possibly the business.
- You want to consider starting your own company in the future.
- You cannot sit idle and do nothing. You live by the impact of your work and that's what drives you.
- And most importantly, you're willing to take (calculated) risks, work hard, and possibly getting (slightly) lower pay in the early years of your career because you trust in compounding nature of knowledge and money. This can feel extra difficult the moment your friends are making a little more than you while also having a better work-life balance. But remember, you're playing the long-term game here. If you cannot do this, you don't need to read further.

Having said this, I'd say there are few good teams at MNCs where you can get to learn a lot - but it's just that in a big company you generally have less say in the team/product you work with. And if you want to join an MNC, try to see if you can join a new product because the reason why most teams in MNCs are slow is because the core tech is mostly already built and most of the effort goes into either maintaining or selling it to more customers. Adding to this, Amazon is an MNC which also makes you grow almost like a startup - you may consider that if you want something in between. But I personally don't like their culture based on what I know from my friends.

To add, you can always switch between the two (just match their expectations in terms of skills and prove it well in the interview). I have seen people who have worked at startups for several years and then switched to MNCs ([Aprit Bhayani]() is a good example) and vice-versa ([Shobhit Gupta]() from my times at FamPay).

## Building a good profile:

- Be good with system design. I'd suggest watching videso of ByteByteGo, Hussein Nasser, and Arpit Bhayani for this. Furthermore, these are the important topics:

1. Databases (most important for startups):
   - Must know: Schemas, Normalization, Indexes, Joins, ACID properties (esp. Isolation), SQL vs NoSQL
   - Good to know: CAP theorem, Sharding, Replication, Transactions
2. Networking:
   - Must know: TCP vs UDP, HTTP vs HTTPS, DNS, What happens when you type a google.com in the browser
   - Good to know: RPC vs gRPC, Load Balancing, Reverse proxy
3. Operating systems:
   - Must know: Processes vs Threads, Concurrency vs Parallelism
   - Good to know: Scheduling, Deadlocks, Virtualization of memory, Paging
4. Object oriented design:
   - Must know: Inheritance, SOLID principles
   - Good to know: Design patterns

- Be decent with DSA but not super good. Generally speaking, the smaller the startup, the easier the DSA round (infact, many startups don't ask DSA at all). Being good enough with Medium level questions of arrays & hashmap, two pointers, linked list, stacks, backtracking, bit manipulation, and common tree/graph/dp questions is sufficient for most startups. Remember competitive programming is very different from DSA. Codeforces/Codechef is competitive programming while DSA is Leetcode. I'd suggest refer [Neetcode](https://neeetcode.com/) for DSA and solve 150 questions from that. Each of them have a dedicated solution video which is great.
- Try to crack internships while you're still in college - the more the better for the long run.
- Google Summer of Code or contributions to popular open source projects is very helpful in getting interviews at good startups. Many startups explicitly mentioned that you get a preference if you have a good open source profile.
- Prepare a Good CV that highlights your internships, projects, and achievements.

## Pitfalls to avoid:

- Be very critical about the startup you're joining. It's very easy to get carried away by the hype and the "vision" of the company. Do your research and talk to people who have worked there. Ask them about the culture, the work, the team, the founders, the vision, the funding, the growth, the pay, the perks, the work-life balance, etc. Unfortunately, most startups are mess that pay low. Prevention is better than cure.
- You don't have to cross all the boxes out of my advices. I always say, `P(getting a job) = P(skills >= threshold for job) * P(luck)`. Here luck means set of questions thrown at you, your confidence, your health, interviewer's style, etc. It's really hard to control the luck part, so you must keep continously upskilling (so you almost always cross threshold) and keep giving interviews (so you increase your chances of getting lucky).
- Never settle for less payscale because founders promise "growth" and stocks that are "worth" millions of dollars.
  - Always be well paid throughout your career because when you're looking for a job change, almost all the companies ask for your current payscale and give raise on that. If your current payscale is low, most companies will just lowball you.
  - Join a startup with the expectation that your stocks won't materialize and all you'll get is base pay + high rate compounding of growth. It's the growth that you're after, not the million $ stocks. If stocks materialize, that's great, but don't make it your primary reason.
  - Any startup offering `< 14 LPA` + X lakhs stocks for a fresher is a risk because most stocks don't materialize.

## Extra suggestions:

- Prefer companies with a serial founder and look at how their previous company did and what their ex-employees are doing now. There are exception to this if you believe the founder is young but really smart, kind, and has a good vision.
  - Special note, don't fall for pedigree college/companies of the founders (IITs, IIMs, FAANG, etc). I can assure you it doesn't increase chances of success in most cases.
- Try to find good mentors (ideally role models) along the way. Look upto people who are 5-10 years (anything more is hard to relate, anything less won't give you much insights) ahead of you and stay in touch with them. Ideally, these should be the people like whom you want to be in the future. For me, [Valentin Lorentz] (My GSoC Mentor), [Vinod Bollini] (Met him online in a slack community) and [Nirant Kalsiwal] (GenAI community admin) have been great inspirations and they have helped me a lot in my journey. I'm really grateful to them.
