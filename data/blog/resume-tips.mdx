# Guiding principles:

- Make your resume easy to read and highlight your strongest projects/achievements - make them bold.
- Keep the design consistent and don't use too many colors or fonts. Less is more.
- Some things are more valuable than others (Pareto principle).
  - This means `Internship >> Interesting Projects and/or good DSA profile >> Education/Courses/Certificates`
  - The order of those things matters. So you should put them in order of how attractive they are
    - Keep your education on top only if you believe that's better than your internships or projects (ideally if you have `CGPA >= 7.5` and are from a reputed college).
    - If education isn't your best front, rather focus on internships, projects, and DSA. You can choose to put education towards the end and maybe even skip it.
- Know when it's good enough. ATS checkers are fake and referrals are more efficient
  - Don't over-optimize your resume. Reach a good point and then focus more on asking for referrals.
  - ATS checkers are fake. It's a product that solves a non-existing problem. Read [this](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1585359533781946369) tweet by ex Engineering Manager of Uber.
  - So in reality, your resumes will be looked upon by an actual human (HR) either before interviewing or after a coding round (when hiring in bulk). Referrals (esp in startups) mean the HR is likely to see the resume within a few hours/days.
  - Anyone would be happy to refer you if your resume is good enough because they get huge bonus money when you
    join and stay beyond the probation period (mostly 3+ months). So please never shy away from asking for a referral.
    Just shoot connection requests to 5-10 people in the company you wanna work for. People on the internet can be more
    kind than you imagine.
- No good company expects managerial skills from an early career engineer role
  - Focus on technical skills rather than managerial skills when you're applying for a fresher role. Nobody expects you to manage others.
- Avoid writing more than 1 page resume.
  - Resume is there for others to instantly decide whether to take you forward or not.
  - More than a long resume, what helps is that they can instantly see what they were looking for.
  - Alter the spacing and font size to adjust more or less of the content. Maintain a decent margin and good readability.
  - If you want to write a detailed intro of yourself, feel free to write on your blog or Github profile README.

# Important Sections

## Skills:

- Never rate yourself in a tech stack. This means writing "Python (3/5)" or "Express (intermediate)" is bad.
- Rather just mention whatever tech stack you're familiar with.
- You can split this section into Languages, Frameworks, and Tools. But feel free to keep them as one

## Social profiles:

- Add links to your LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github.
- Most recruiters will focus only on Github. So try to have some good projects and green squares (commits) there.
- If you do DSA or CP, add those as well and highlight the number of problems solved or your rank/rating.
  - It's really important to understand that DSA and CP are very different.
  - DSA is mostly standard LeetCode questions but CP is Codeforces/Codechef competitions.
  - CP is a sport. It's not for everyone. But those who master it find it easy to crack DSA rounds.
  - Also, don't hate DSA. Try to see the beauty of the algorithm instead of hating the grind.
  - Instead of solving thousands of problems you may choose to solve selected problems on platforms like [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/practice)

## Experience (Internships):

I'll write a more detailed blog about getting jobs and internships later on. But for now, I'd just say this is the
most attractive part of your resume. If you don't have one, try to do improve other parts (projects and DSA) and grab an internship based on those.

## Side Projects:

- Most interviewers don't expect super cool (or unique) projects from freshers. It's great if you can, but you don't have to.
- But what they definitely expect is that whenever they ask you any question related to your project, you should be able to give a detailed answer.

### How to find good project ideas?

- Write code to solve your problem. I always wanted to track my time so I built [this](/blog/quantified-self)
- Bots, extensions, and scripts are generally easier to build but can lead to great projects
  like [iitbh-cgpa browser extension](https://github.com/OpenLake/iitbh-cgpa) - Built by my friend Ambar and used by ~200 students now!
- Search for datasets on Kaggle that you find interesting and try to make sense of them using stats and visualizations.
- Pick projects from Youtube/Udemy/Coursera courses and extend them to add a few more features and make them different (even if slightly).

Bonus tip: Write a blog about your projects and post on Medium and Dev.to. This can impress interviewers for going an extra mile by documenting and improving your social media reach and writing skills. This can be very beneficial in the long run.

## Pitfalls:

### Which language/framework should I learn?

- Many students wonder if they should go for Java or CPP, Python or Javascript (NodeJS), etc.
- The thing is for most companies it doesn't matter in the end. You can easily learn a new language once you have mastered at least one.
- To add, all the languages are turing complete so literally all the paradigms can be used in all the languages. It's the /design/syntax that can make it feel easier or difficult to use a certain paradigm in a language.
- This is a bit difficult (and optional) part, but if you really want to understand a language, try to implement its interesting features in your favourite language. For example, one could try to implement interesting features of Golang (coroutines, channels, etc.) in their favourite language (say Python)
- The same advice goes for learning frameworks (Say Django vs. FastAPI, React vs. Vue). Just learn either of them, whichever feels more natural. When required in your job, you can always learn the other one.

### Resume-driven development

- You don't need to learn something just because it's "cool" or "in-demand".
- For example, Kubernetes is powerful but every team doesn't need it. But because it's a buzzword, many students run after trying to add "Kubernetes" in their resume even if they don't even know the basics of it.
- It's okay to learn something for curiousity but don't do it because it's "cool". Have the right principles in-place.
- Instead of such buzz words, focus on fundamentals of OS, networking, concurrency, parallelism, etc.

## Where and how to apply for jobs

Use these sites:

- [WellFound](https://wellfound.com/) (previously AngelList and great for remote jobs)
- [Work At a startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/) (YC backed startups)
- Setup [LinkedIn alerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLOBk_HaYQo) for your favourite companies
- Influencers who post good job opportunities on LinkedIn and Twitter (very good source)
- Telegram groups: (really good source)
  1. https://t.me/offcampus_phodenge
  2. https://t.me/goyalarsh
  3. https://t.me/dot_aware
  4. https://t.me/akashthedeveloper
  5. https://t.me/PLACEMENTLELO

Please remember that it's always better to take referrals. It can help you skip the competition and at least get you noticed by HR. Just send 5-10 LinkedIn connection requests and ask them if they can see your resume and tell you if they'd like to refer you. Be respectful and have a good CV, many people would reply. Say something like this:

```
Hi [name], I hope you're doing well.

I came across a job opportunity at [your-company] and would appreciate it if you take a look at my resume and
let me know if you can refer me.

<!-- Link to the job posting (additionally mention the job id if there's one) -->
<!-- Attach your resume or give a link to the same -->
Link: https://company.example.com/careers/job/4 (Job ID: 4)
Resume: https://drive.google.com/my-resume.pdf

Thanks a lot!
```

- [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/)

- You can try using tools like [Resume Parser](https://www.affinda.com/resume-parser) and [ResumeWorded](https://resumeworded.com) but remember the score is not very important and [ATS bots don't exist](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1585359533781946369). It's better to focus more on getting a referral once you know it's good enough.
