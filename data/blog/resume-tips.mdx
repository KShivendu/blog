# Guiding principles:

- Make your resume easy to read and highlight your strongest projects/achievements - make them bold.
- Keep the design consistent and don't use too many colors or fonts. Less is more.
- Some things are more valuable than others (Pareto principle).
  - This means `Internship >> Interesting Projects or good DSA profile >> Education/Courses/Certificates`
  - Order of those things matter. So you should put them in order of how attractive they are
    - Keep your education on top only if you believe that's better than your internships or projects (ideally if you have `CGPA > 8` and are from a reputated college).
    - If education isn't your best front, rather focus on creating good projects. In general, this is better. Don't cling to your college branding when you're applying off campus.
- Know when it's good enough.
  - Don't over optimize your resume, it's not worth fighting for 100/100 ATS score. Reach a good point and then focus more on asking for referrals.
  - Anyone would be happy to refer you if your resume is good enough because they get a huge bonus money when you
    join and stay beyond the probation period (mostly 3+ months). So please never shy away from asking for a referral.
    Just shoot connection requests to 5-10 people in the company you wanna work for. People on the internet can be more
    kind that you imagine.
- No one wants managers for a early career engineer role

  - Focus on technical skills rather than managerial skills when you're applying for a fresher role. Nobody expects you to manage others.
    It's a plus if you're good at it but that's not what they are looking for. So even if want to mention, don't make it your primary strength.

- Must have sections: Skills, Experience (internships and full time), side projects, and education.

# Sections

## Skills:

- Never rate yourself in a tech stack. This means "Python (3/5)" or "Express (intermediate)" are bad.
- Rather just mention whatever tech stack you're familiar with.
- You can split this section into: Languages, Frameworks, and Tools. But feel free to keep them as one

## Experience (Internships):

I'll write a more detailed blog about getting jobs and internships later on. But for now, I'd just say this is the
most attractive parts of your resume. If you don't have one yet, try to do good projects and grab an internship based on those.

## DSA vs Competitive Programming

- It's really important to understand that DSA and CP are very different.
- DSA is mostly standard LeetCode questions but CP is Codeforces/Codechef competitions.
- CP is a sport. It's not for everyone. But those who master it find it easy to crack DSA rounds.
- Also, don't hate DSA. Try to see the beauty of the algorithm instead of hating the grind.
- Instead of solving thousands of problems you may choose to solve selected problems on platforms like https://neetcode.io/practice

## Projects:

- Most interviewers don't expect super cool (or unique) projects from freshers. It's great if you can, but you don't have to.
- But what they expect is that whenever they ask you any question related to your project, you should be able to give a detailed answer.

### How to find good project ideas?

- Write code to solve your own problem. I always wanted to track my time so I built [this](/blog/quantified-self)
- Bots, extensions, and scripts are generally easier to build but can lead to great projects
  like https://github.com/OpenLake/iitbh-cgpa - Built by my friend Ambar and used by ~200 students now!
- Search for datasets on Kaggle that you find interesting and try to make sense of it using stats and visualizations.
- Pick projects from Youtube/Udemy/Coursera courses and extend them to add few more features and make it different (even if slightly).

Pro tip: Write a blog about your projects and post on Medium and Dev.to. This can impress interviewers for going an extra mile by
documenting and improve you social media reach and writing skills. This can be very beneficial in the long run.

## Pitfalls:

### Which language/framework should I learn?

- Many students wonder if they should go for Java or CPP, Python or Javascript (NodeJS), etc.
- The thing is for most companies it doesn't matter in the end. You can easily learn a new language once you have mastered atleast one.
- To add, all the languages are turing complete so literally all the paradigms can be used in all the languages. It's the syntax
  that can make something feel easier or difficult a paradigm in a language.
- This is a bit difficult (and optional) part, but if you really want to understand a language, try to implement it's interesting features
  in your favourite language. For example, one could try to implement interesting features of golang (coroutines, channels, etc) in their
  favourite language (say python)
- The same advice goes for learning framework (Say Django vs FastAPI, React vs Vue). Just learn either of them, whichever feels more natural.
  When required in your job, you can always learn the other one.

### Resume driven development

- You don't need to learn something just because it's "cool" or "in-demand".
- For example, Kubernetes is powerful but every team doesn't need it. But because it's a buzz-word, it's easy to fall for the trap
  and run after trying to add "Kubernetes" in your resume even if you just know the basic of it.
- It's okay to learn something for curiousity but don't do it because it's "cool". Have the right principles in-place.
- Instead of such buzz words, focus on fundamentals of OS, Networking, Concurrency & Parallelism, etc.

- You can try using tools like https://www.affinda.com/resume-parser but don't try too hard to increase the ATS score. It's better
  to focus more on getting a referral after a threshold.
