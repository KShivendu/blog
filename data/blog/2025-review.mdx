2025 was the year I learned that building from scratch isn't about external validation — it's about the intrinsic excitement of understanding complexity, building taste, and pursuing mastery. It was also a year of overwhelming but valuable travel, where I learned to appreciate the privilege of movement while recognizing when to pause.

This year brought significant growth in my career, deeper relationships with family and friends, and a lot of movement—both geographically and mentally. Here's what stood out.

## Career: Building Taste and Hard things

The biggest shift this year was starting to build from scratch. I launched [smoldb](https://github.com/KShivendu/smoldb), a database project that's teaching me more about early design decisions than any code review ever could. Having full freedom to express my ideas is rapidly improving my programming taste.

At Qdrant, I worked on some of our most important features for our 2025 roadmap:

- **Read-write segregation** that will power multi-zone/region cluster sync
- **[Tiered multi-tenancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Ux-Lgx93w)** — one of our biggest milestones this year
- Major improvements to our distributed systems and storage layer: consensus, shards, replication, and the cluster manager service that I built.

Beyond distributed systems, I dove deep into ML (thanks Karpathy Sensei) and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/kshivendu/grpo). The outcomes might not be visible yet, but the foundation has been laid.

The most unexpected career moment? Receiving 2 inbound offers from USA companies with O1 visa sponsorship. While I didn't pursue them due to personal reasons, it was validating — a signal that I have the option to move to the USA if I ever wanted to.

## Speaking and Sharing Knowledge

I gave talks at several places this year, including Microsoft Bangalore, PES University, and IIT Bhilai (my alma mater). Each of these opportunities was meaningful and rewarding in its own way.

Delivering my **first international conference talk at DjangoCon Chicago** was a truly unforgettable experience — the opportunity to engage with a global audience was both nerve-wracking and deeply inspiring.

I also organized the first-ever IIT Bhilai alumni chapter meetups in Bangalore and Delhi and attended conferences like Fifth Elephant and Rust/Systems/Python meetups, where I got to connect with the local tech community in Bangalore.

## Travel: Overwhelming But Valuable

This was a year of frequent travel—overwhelming at times, but I don't regret any of it. I'm grateful for the privilege to have visited multiple cities and countries:

- **United States**: Chicago for speaking at DjangoCon, then flew to San Francisco — my dream city. I visited Stanford to meet my junior and college friend, met past mentors and friends, attended meetups, and went on a road trip with college friends.
- **Europe**: Qdrant offsite in Mallorca Island, Spain, followed by Italy (Venice, Florence, Rome). Italy is now my favorite country in Europe.
- **India**: Multiple trips across the country — family trips to North India (hometown and Delhi) and South India (Ooty, Rameshwaram), ending the year with a beautiful Kerala trip (Kochi, Allepey, Trivandrum, Varkala).

The travel was intense and exhausting, but each trip brought something valuable: reconnecting with family, meeting mentors, experiencing new cultures, and building relationships.

## Learning and Growth

Beyond technical skills, this year brought several important realizations:

- **Relationships that shape us**: This year's travel, meetups, and time with family and friends reminded me that relationships are investments that compound over time. The mentors who guided me, the friends I reconnected with, and the family moments I prioritized — these connections have shaped where I am today, and I want to give back to them.

- **The joy of mastery**: Building smoldb in public has given me zero external gains so far, but that's not why I'm doing it. I'm intrinsically motivated by the excitement of understanding all this complexity. Building from scratch forces you to make foundational decisions that expose gaps in your understanding—you can't hide behind existing abstractions. The pursuit of mastery itself is the reward, and it's accelerating my growth in ways that reading code or working within established systems never could.

- **Validation vs. pursuit**: Getting O1 visa offers was validating, but the bigger lesson was learning to separate external validation from internal direction. I'm already building things I'm excited about, and while certain opportunities might accelerate my timeline, I've learned that career optimization isn't the only optimization that matters.

- **Sharing accelerates learning**: Giving talks and writing forced me to articulate ideas clearly. The process of explaining concepts publicly—whether in a conference talk or a blog post—revealed what I actually understood versus what I only thought I understood.

- **Mental health as foundation**: Prioritizing mental well-being wasn't a nice-to-have—it became clear it's the foundation everything else builds on. This investment pays dividends in focus, creativity, and resilience.

## What I'd Do Differently

Looking back, I wish I had:

- Started building from scratch earlier — projects like smoldb are improving my programming taste faster than anything else, and I should have begun this journey sooner
- Prioritized health and sleep from day one — treating these as non-negotiables rather than "work in progress" would have improved my entire year, especially during the intense travel periods

## What's Next

2026 feels like it will be a year of transitions. I'll be turning 25, which feels like a big mental milestone — a shift from early twenties to mid-twenties that brings different perspectives and priorities. I'm focusing on:

- **Deepening technical expertise**: Continuing to build smoldb and contribute to Qdrant's core systems
- **More ML**: I'm expecting to dive much deeper into machine learning in 2026. The foundation I laid this year with ML and reinforcement learning should start showing more visible outcomes
- **Maintaining balance**: I want to be more intentional about spending time on relationships, travel, hobbies, and life outside of work — not just because it's healthy, but because these experiences make the work itself more meaningful.
- **Pursuing mastery**: Continuing to build smoldb and dive deeper into the complexity—not for external validation, but for the intrinsic satisfaction of understanding systems at their core

## Gratitude

I'm grateful for my team at Qdrant, the mentors who have guided me, friends who have supported me, and family who have always been there. I deeply appreciate the privilege to work on hard problems, travel to new places, and keep learning every day.

Here's to 2026 — may it be a year of depth over breadth, quality over quantity, and building things that matter. The goal isn't to do more, it's to do better.
