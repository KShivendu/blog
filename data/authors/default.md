Hello, I am Kumar Shivendu. 👨‍💻

👉 A self‑motivated engineer who loves contributing to open source and building products with his Software Development and Machine Learning skills.

👉 I'm interested in building products for the scale of millions and solving unstructured problems with enthusiasm.

✨ Fun fact: I built my first software product when I was just 13 years old :D

Past Experience :

- Backend Intern @ FamPay (YC 19)
- Google Summer Of Code Student at Software Heritage
- Software Engineer Intern at Logy.AI
- Data Science Intern at IIT Mandi

🦄 I am actively looking for Software Engineering roles in startups with a cause that I believe in so that we get to mutually accelerate each other's growth. 🚀
If your startup is based on open source business model or is remote-first, that would be a huge plus ;)

I'm a friendly guy who loves talking to random awesome people on the internet. Feel free to DM me. 🙋🏻‍♂️
