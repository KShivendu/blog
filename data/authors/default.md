Hey there. I am Kumar Shivendu. 👨‍💻 Here's a [PDF version of my Resume](/resume-pdf)

I build vector search engine [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) and have previously worked at [SuperTokens](https://github.com/SuperTokens) (YC 20) and [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) (YC 19).
In my free time, I try to explore the explainability and limits of vector search, embeddings, and [RAG](https://github.com/kshivendu/rag-cookbook). I love information retrieval (search engines, LLMs), distributed systems, observability, and scraping/mining data.

📩 Reach out to me if you need help with RAG

I'm also open to speaking opportunites at reputed conferences and meetups. Some of my previous talks can be found at [talks.kshivendu.dev](https://talks.kshivendu.dev)

Some of my recent side projects:

- [I Reverse-Engineered Exa.ai Infrastructure Cost with Napkin Math](https://www.kshivendu.dev/blog/exa-napkin-math) I fused my own understanding of search and napkin math with insights from all public Exa.AI blogs/videos to reverse engineer their system and infra cost.
- [smoldb](https://x.com/KShivendu_/status/1956670518293073987) I'm building a distributed database in Rust to improve my programming taste, intution, and understanding of CS fundamentals.
- [Monitoring my life with Grafana, Prometheus, and InfluxDB](/blog/quantified-self) I'm collecting my health, time, and productivity data from all of my devices and putting it all together in Grafana dashboards.
