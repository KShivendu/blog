Hey there. I am Kumar Shivendu. üë®‚Äçüíª Here's a [PDF version of my Resume](/resume-pdf)

I build devtools at [SuperTokens](https://github.com/SuperTokens) (YC 20) and have previously worked at [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) (YC 19). I'm proficient in Python and JS and have dabbled in production grade Java and Go as well. I'm deeply passionate about open source, information retrieval (search engines, query languages, and databases), and dev tools, and I have good experience with each of them.

These days I'm exploring the Generative AI space (especially semantic search and LLMs) by building side projects like:

- [Benchmarking open source vector DBs](https://nirantk.com/writing/pgvector-vs-qdrant/) like Qdrant and Pgvector that went [viral on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NirantK/status/1674110063286571008?s=20) and was noticed by creators of Github Copilot, Yahoo search, and Spotify recommendation engine!
- [Suggest-AI](https://twitter.com/KShivendu_/status/1655603676189437953?s=20) 2k+ people used my side project to search for 10k+ different things. Eventually took it down because it didn't have a monetization strategy.
- [Cloning voices](https://twitter.com/KShivendu_/status/1650858929558278145) to make popular singers sing different songs, etc.

üöÄ Experience:

- Software Engineer @ [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/) (YC 20)
- Software Engineer Intern @ [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) (YC 19)
- Google Summer Of Code Student @ [Software Heritage organization](https://softwareheritage.org/)
- ML + SDE Intern @ [Logy.AI](https://logy.ai/)
- ML Research Intern @ [IIT Mandi](https://iitmandi.ac.in/)

ü¶Ñ I am looking for Software Engineering and DevRel roles at high growth startups having a mission that I truly believe in. If your startup culture is based on open source and believes in transparency, that would be a huge plus ;)

Some of the coolest things I shipped recently:

- Advanced search engine for Software Heritage: I designed an advanced search engine with a custom query language that operates on a corpus of over 250 million repositories containing more than 15 billion files. This archive is the largest software archive globally, surpassing even Github.
- Multi-Factor Authentication for SuperTokens: I architected customizable MFA features that enable the addition of multi-factor authentication to any application in minutes. This was one of our most requested enterprise features and there's no other provider at the moment that offers this level of flexibility.
- Semantic search browser extension (side project): I developed a browser extension that enhances the existing search capabilities of any website. It allows users to go beyond traditional filters and sorting methods, enabling them to ask questions like "Show me all mobile phones on sale with a rating of 4 stars and atleast 100 reviews" or "I'm feeling sad, show me some food to make me feel better". The extension utilizes intelligent heuristics for data scraping on the fly and employs vector embeddings for finding relevant items.
