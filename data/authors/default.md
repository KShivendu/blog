Hey there. I am Kumar Shivendu. üë®‚Äçüíª Here's a [PDF version of my Resume](/resume-pdf)

I build vector search engine [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) and have previously worked at [SuperTokens](https://github.com/SuperTokens) (YC 20) and [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) (YC 19).
In my free time, I try to explore the explainability and limits of vector search, embeddings, and [RAG](https://github.com/kshivendu/rag-cookbook). I'm passionate about software performance, information retrieval (search engines, query languages, databases, and LLMs), and scraping/mining data.

üì© Reach out to me if you need help with RAG

I'm also open to speaking opportunites at reputed conferences and meetups. Some of my previous talks can be found at [talks.kshivendu.dev](https://talks.kshivendu.dev)

Some of my recent side projects:

- [Monitoring my life with Grafana, Prometheus, and InfluxDB](/blog/quantified-self) I'm collecting my health, time, and productivity data from all of my devices and putting it all together in Grafana dashboards.
- [Suggest-AI](https://twitter.com/KShivendu_/status/1655603676189437953?s=20) 2k+ people used my side project to search for 10k+ different things. Eventually took it down because it didn't have a monetization strategy.
- [Cloning voices](https://twitter.com/KShivendu_/status/1650858929558278145) to make popular singers sing different songs, etc.
