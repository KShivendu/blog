Hey there. I am Kumar Shivendu. üë®‚Äçüíª Here's a [PDF version of my Resume](/static/KumarShivendu_CV.pdf)

I work as a Software Engineer at [SuperTokens](https://github.com/SuperTokens) (YC 20) and have previously worked at [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) (YC 19). I'm proficient with Python and JS and have a good understanding of Java and Go. I'm deeply passionate about open source, information retrieval (search engines, query languages, & databases), and building dev tools and I have a tons of experience with each of them.

Some of the coolest things I've built so far:

- Advanced search engine for Software Heritage: Advanced search with custom query language that works on top of a corpus of 200M+ repositories containing 14B+ files! This is the largest software archive in the world and hence is larger than Github itself.
- Multi Factor Authentication for SuperTokens: Designed one a kind and customizable SDKs that allow you to add multi factor authentication to your app in minutes with ability to dynamically decide which factors to use for each user. No such product exists right now.

{/_ - Graph database for package metadata for Software Heritage: We extracted and indexed metadata of 6M+ unique libraries from 200M+ repositories and ingested all of that in a graph database. _/}

- Semantic search browser extension (side project): A semantic search browser extension that extends existing search features of any website. Allowing you to go beyond all traditional filters and sorting approaches so that you can just ask questions like "Show me all the products that are on sale and have a rating of 4 or more stars", "I'm feeling sad, show me some food that can make me feel better". It is powered by very smart heuristics for scraping the right data and then it uses vector embeddings to match against the right items.

üöÄ Experience:

ü¶Ñ I am looking for Software Engineering roles at high growth startups having a mission that I truly believe in. If your startup culture is based on open source and believes in transparency, that would be a huge plus ;)

These days I'm exploring semantic search and Generative AI models like GPT-3 and Stable diffusion by building side projects like [Suggest-AI](https://twitter.com/KShivendu_/status/1655603676189437953?s=20) (700+ people used it to search for 2000+ different things), [cloning voices](https://twitter.com/KShivendu_/status/1650858929558278145) to make popular singers sing different songs, etc.

I'm a friendly guy who enjoys helping random awesome people on the internet. Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_KShivendu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshivendu/). üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
