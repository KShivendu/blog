Hello, I am Kumar Shivendu. 👨‍💻

👉 A self‑motivated engineer who loves contributing to open source and building products with his Software Development and Machine Learning skills.

👉 I'm interested in building products for the scale of millions and solving unstructured problems with enthusiasm.

✨ Fun fact: I built my first software product when I was just 13 years old :D

Experience :

- Software Engineer @ [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/) (YC 20)
- Backend Intern @ [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) (YC 19)
- Google Summer Of Code Student at [Software Heritage](https://softwareheritage.org/)
- Software Engineer Intern at [Logy.AI](https://logy.ai/)
- Data Science Intern at [IIT Mandi](https://iitmandi.ac.in/)

🦄 I am actively looking for Software Engineering roles in startups with a cause that I believe in so that we get to mutually accelerate each other's growth.

🚀 If your startup is based on open source business model or is remote-first, that would be a huge plus ;)
